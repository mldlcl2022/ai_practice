This repository is for AI studying.

The type of work can be identified through the filename.  
All files are composed of model name, task type and dataset name.  
Also, all experiments are conducted based on .ipynb files.  
This is because it's easier with .ipynb files to understand, and converting them to .py files is not difficult.  
<br>
For example, in the case of using the ResNet model for an image classification task with the CIFAR10 dataset the filename is named as 'ResNet_cls_CIFAR10.ipynb'.
