This repository is for AI studying.  
<br>
The type of work can be identified through the file name.  
All files are composed of task type, method or model name and dataset name.  
Also, all experiments are conducted based on .ipynb files.  
This is because it's easier with .ipynb files to understand, and converting them to .py files is not difficult.  
<br>
For example, when performing linear probing with ResNet model using the CIFAR10 dataset, the file name would be 'lp_ResNet_CIFAR10.ipynb'.  
Another example is when conducting an experiment to calculate the ECE(Expected Calibration Error) of ResNet model using CIFAR10 dataset, the file name would be 'ece_ResNet_CIFAR10.ipynb'.

< Task type >  
* reg : regression  
* cls : classification  
* pre : pretrain  
* lp  : linear probing  
* ft  : fine tuning  
* fs  : few show learning
